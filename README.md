# Youtube-Downlaoder
Turns Youtube videos into mp4's

REQUIRES FFMPEG

Problems - 
Doesn't work for some videos and cannot figure out why, will try though (FIXED)

I can add 1440p to the options but it will be just a little difficult, if you really want me to make a issue stating that you do and I will try.
